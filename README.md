This repo contains all the work I have been doing while deepening my knowledge of Data Science with python.

This project actually started because of my deep interest in Statistics and Machine Learning and I will be posting
content over time and updating it.

### Why did I start
Actually I always had a certain knowledge of the tools and technology out there but I did not believe it was 
as deep (Deep Learning pun?) as I could be.


# Starting Point
My initial Starting point came after watching a Data Science Bootcamp video created by Siraj on youtube.
Video link can be found here [3 Month Daya Science Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rDhY1P3YLA&t=506s)

In actuality I am not fully following the video step by step because I do have previous knowledge of certain statistical concepts
and programming experience in Python so I modify my experience (switch certain coursers or books for others) as I progress.

# Week 1

For week one I spent some time brushing up on the [Introduction to Python for Data Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT208x+1T2019/course/) course

### Topics covered
- Numpy
- Plotting with Matplotlb
- Control flow with Pandas
  
Although the course did not go deep into these topics it was a great introduction filled with great exercises

by the end of this course we decided to use Pandas to Taggle a well known Kaggle Dataset

[Wine Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews)

To test our Python skills we used Pandas to filter the data to get revealing insights then used Matplotlib to visualize these results.

The full Project can be found here [Week 1 Pandas for data science](Week_1_Pandas)

for example here is a simple graph of the highest reviewed wines using a scatter plot with x axis for avg points and y axis for avg_price and the total number of reviews was used for the sizes of each bubble.

To add more fun to this project I added a svg of wine countries listed on a map
