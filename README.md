This repo contains all the work I have been doing while deepening my knowledge of Data Science with python.

This project actually started because of my deep interest in Statistics and Machine Learning and I will be posting
content over time and updating it.

### Why did I start
Actually I always had a certain knowledge of the tools and technology out there but I did not believe it was 
as deep (Deep Learning pun?) as I could be.


# Starting Point
My initial Starting point came after watching a Data Science Bootcamp video created by Siraj on youtube.
In actuality I am not fully following the video step by step because I do have previous knowledge of certain statistical concepts
and programming experience in Python so I modify my experience (switch certain coursers or books for others) as I progress.
